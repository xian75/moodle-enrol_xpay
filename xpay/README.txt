DESCRIPTION
-----------

This plugin handles credit card payments by conducting PxPay transactions
through the xPay CartaSi gateway. A successful payment results in the
enrolment of the user. We use PxPay because it does not require handling the
credit card details in Moodle. A truncated form of the credit card number is
returned in the PxPay response and is stored for reference only.

Details of the xPay API are online:

INSTALLATION
------------

Download the latest enrol_xpay.zip from the Moodle Plugins Directory and unzip
the contents into the enrol/xpay directory.
